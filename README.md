This is the CND project for nokia
We plan to use 3 topology in network.py
The first one is ZR, the second one is ZR+OEO, final one is OEO.
1.Create the topology
2.Find the shortest path matching reach table
3.Calculate cost

We use no grooming algorithm and compare the cost.
And now we try to use traffic grooming.
